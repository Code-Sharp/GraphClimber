## Whatttt?

Yeah, For example, If you wanna check the size of a object and his descendents in your .net heap - You can do it easily with graph climber.

Other examples :
- Writing serializers / deserializers without having to use Expressions or runtime code generation
- Doing something with all the objects that implements some interface within a graph of an object

## Development stages

1. Writing full API (_Current Stage_)
2. Implementing GraphClimber with full tests
3. Writing examples
